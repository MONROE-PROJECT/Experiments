# Experiment to showcase the virtual machine support in the monroe platform 
The purpose of this experiment is to output a log of the configuration and results of connectivity tests when run as a virtual machine or as a docker container.

The experiment can run both as a virtual machine (by specifing ```"vm":1``` as a parameter when scheduling the experiment) or as a a normal experiment by not specifinyng any parameter. 
Do keep in mind that the experiment is rather large (ie 200MB) and therefore should not be run on MBB only nodes.
